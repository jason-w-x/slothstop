main server, listens for requests from port 50001

on receiving a request, spawn a process to handle all comms for that request

each request will have a session id, and sequence # for desync issues


Requests will contain callsign, payload weight, parachute size, amnt helium, balloon size

Upon receiving a request, check to see if a request with matching inputs is already active
     - check callsign only? or hash entire request?
